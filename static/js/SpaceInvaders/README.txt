This is a prototype for the Vocab Space Invaders game!

To run the game (which is built with Phaser), you need to use a web server such as WAMP.
An easy webserver option for Google Chrome users is "Web Server for Chrome" extension.

Link to Chrome extension.

Once you have a web server, simply set the target folder to this game folder and run!
